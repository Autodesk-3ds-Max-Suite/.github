## About Autodesk 3ds Max

Developed by **Autodesk**, 3ds Max has been a cornerstone in **3D visualization, design, and media production** for over two decades. It powers architectural visualization, product design, and AAA game environments with unmatched stability and rendering fidelity.  

Its **modifier-based workflow** enables rapid prototyping, while the integrated **Arnold Renderer** brings photorealism directly to the viewport. Architects use 3ds Max for precise CAD integration, while studios rely on it for animation, particle FX, and motion graphics.  

With support for **FBX, DWG, USD, and Substance materials**, 3ds Max connects seamlessly with Revit, Unreal Engine, and Blender — serving as a complete hub for creative professionals.
